Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: c(
    person("Simon", "Couch", , "simon.couch@posit.co", role = c("aut", "cre"),
           comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0001-5676-5107")),

Description: Helps users understand and address error messages using large
    language models. With the tool enabled, errors raised to the user are 
    accompanied by clickable links to "explain" or "fix" the issue. 
    Explanations are printed to the console while fixes implement changes 
    directly; in both cases, the model is supplied context about the files 
    you're working in and the functions you're working with.
